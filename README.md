This Project creates a graph containg cities and connect them using road with weight
The main algorithm is dijkstra, it finds the shortest path between two cities, it can also have a one direction roads created in directed Graph.
This project is made using C++ language and it is for the data structure and algorithm course.

features:
1.Create or load Graph.
2.directed or undirected Graph.
3.update and delete vertcies and edges.
4.save the graph in txt file.
